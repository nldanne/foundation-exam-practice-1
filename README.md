## Exercises


### Diagonal Matrix

Create a function `diagonalMatrix` that takes a matrix as a parameter and returns the diagonal of that matrix. 
The original matrix should remain the same.

Write 1 unit test case.

#### Example 1

Input

```text
[
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
]
```

Output

```text
[
  [1, 0, 0],
  [0, 5, 0],
  [0, 0, 9]
]
```


### Twelve Days of Christmas

Write a method `writeLyrics` which can read and parse a file containing the wrong lyrics of the song 
Twelve days of Christmas.

The method takes a `fileName` as a parameter.

The method should append the correct ordinal suffix for the days written in the lyrics. 
The method should save the correct lyrics in a new text file called *`output.txt`*.

Rules of Ordinal Suffixes in this case: 
- 1 --> 1st
- 2 --> 2nd
- 3 --> 3rd
- etc.

If the file is not found, it should write the following to the console: `File not found: `*`filename`*

[The file can be found here.](./lyrics.txt)

Disclaimer: this exercise turned out to be pretty hard, so if it doesn't work out well, do not worry! I don't know the solution either :').

### Christmas cookies yumyum

Your task is to create a program where Santa gets to eat
cookies made by kids he is visiting during Chritmas Eve.

The program should have a `Santa`, a `Kid`, `Cookie`, `GingerBread`, `SnickerDoodle`, and `ChocoChip` classes.

Create a parent class where it's necessary for them.


#### Cookie

- A cookie has a `type` and `bakingTime`
  - there are three types of Christmas cookies: `GingerBread`, `SnickerDoodle`, and `ChocoChip`
  - the baking time for the gingerbread cookies is **3** hours
  - the baking time for the snickerdoodle cookies is **1** hours
  - the baking time for the chocochip cookies is **2** hours
 

#### Kid

- A kid has a `name`, `age`, `mood`, `freeTime` and `cookieAmount`
  - a kid is either happy or sad
 
- New kids can be created by providing the `name`, `age`.
  Every kid is **happy**,has **4** hours to do whatever they want, and **0**  cookies by default.
  
- It has a `bakeCookies` method that takes a `cookieType` as a paramater and makes the Kid bake the sepcified type of cookies of course.
  - a kid will make cookies if he is *happy* and has enough *freeTime* to bake them 
  - if the baking went successfully, the method should update the number of cookies by 10
  - otherwise, it should remain 0

- It has a `play` method that takes away *2 hours* from a kid's free time.

- It has an `introduce` method which returns an information about the kid.
  For example:

  - `My name is Bob, I am 10 years old. I made 12 cookies for Santa!`
  - `My name is Alice, I am 12 years old. I don't have cookies for Santa.`


#### Santa
- A santa has a `name`, `age`, `cookieAmount`, `cookieLimit`, and a `listOfKids`

- New santa can be created by providing the `name`, `age`.
  - our santa is on a diet, so his intake of cookies can't be more than **100**
  - our santa has an empty list of Kids by default.

- It has an `addKid` method that adds new kids to santa's list of Kids

- It has a `visit` method that lets him eat the cookies the kids' made for him, and returns the amount he has eaten.

- It has an `introduce` method which returns an information about santa.
  For example:

  - `My name is Nicholas, I am 60 years old. I ate 10 cookies, and I can eat much more HOHOHO!`
  - `My name is Claus, I am 54 years old. I didn't eat cookies this evening.`
